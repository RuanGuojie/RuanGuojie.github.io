abstract: Accurate and timely wheat yield prediction is of great importance to global
  food security. Early prediction of wheat yield at a field scale is essential for
  site-specific precision management. This study aimed to develop an in-season wheat
  yield prediction model at field-scale by integrating proximal sensing and weather
  data. Nine multi-N rates field experiments were conducted at five sites involving
  different wheat cultivars from 2010 to 2020. Proximal sensing data were collected
  from a Crop Circle sensor at the stem elongation stage and weather data were collected
  from 30 days before planting to the flowering date. Eleven statistical and machine
  learning (ML) regression algorithms were adopted, along with two aggregation intervals
  (disaggregated or aggregated data) and two feature selection methods (based on Pearson
  Correlation Coefficient or Recursive Feature Elimination). The results revealed
  that the ensemble learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting) achieved
  the best overall performance (R2 = 0.74 ∼ 0.78, RMSE = 0.78 ∼ 0.85 t ha−1). Feature
  importance analysis showed that Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), average
  temperature, minimum temperature, and relative humidity were the most contributory
  features, especially from the planting date to the stem elongation date (for weather
  features). The aggregation approach and feature selection method did not significantly
  affect the yield prediction performance for the seven ML methods. This study introduced
  a promising framework that complements county-scale models and provided insights
  into understanding yield responses to environmental conditions. The best prediction
  model can be applied for guiding real-time sensor-based precision fertilization.
