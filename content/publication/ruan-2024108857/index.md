abstract: The optimal nitrogen (N) application rate is an important concept to guide
  the strategic/static N management of crops. However, there is still a knowledge
  gap on how to combine the optimal N application rate, crop growth status, meteorological,
  and soil multi-source information to make tactic/dynamic N recommendation. For investigating
  the data-driven approaches to optimize nitrogen recommendations for winter wheat,
  this study proposed the concept of optimal topdressing N rate that coupling ‘strategic’
  with ‘tactic’ ideas. Then a direct N fertilizer recommendation algorithm based on
  the optimal topdressing N rate was constructed integrating multi-source data with
  Random Forest (RF). The agronomic, economic, and environmental benefits of the algorithm
  were further evaluated based on a large-scale field-level validation experiments,
  and compared with the indirect N recommendation algorithm of RF-based yield prediction,
  farmers’ conventional N application rate, and regional optimal N application rate.
  Finally, multi-objective evolutionary optimization was used to verify the reasonability
  of the N fertilizer recommendation algorithms. The results showed that the optimal
  topdressing N algorithm had good model performance (Random Forest prediction R2 = 0.59 ∼ 0.72,
  RMSE = 39.63 ∼ 40.48 kg/ha), and vegetation indices, maximum temperature, and solar
  radiation were important features. The validation experiment results showed that
  compared to conventional management measures, the optimal topdressing N algorithm
  could reduce N fertilizer application by 18.9 % ∼ 48.4 % with intelligent adjustment,
  improve partial factor productivity by 12.99 % to 46.09 %, and reduce reactive N
  losses and greenhouse gas emissions by 20.56 % ∼ 47.24 % and 16.34 % ∼ 40.45 %,
  respectively. The rationality verification of solving nitrogen topdressing rate
  through multi-objective evolutionary algorithm proved that both indirect and direct
  N recommendation algorithms could make decisions within a reasonable threshold.
  The study provided insights for the data-driven based N management, strategy selection,
  and benefit evaluation process of N recommendation.
